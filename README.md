# ❤️ Heart Failure Prediction - ML Project

This project is built as part of the **Predictive Modelling Bootcamp by Devtown**. It uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of a heart failure event based on clinical records.

## 🚀 Objective

To train a Machine Learning model on the **Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset**, achieve over **80% accuracy**, and deploy it using a **Flask web app** with custom frontend styling.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repo**

```
git clone https://github.com/Anish-kan/PredictiveModelingUsingFlask.git
cd heart-failure-predictor
```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
